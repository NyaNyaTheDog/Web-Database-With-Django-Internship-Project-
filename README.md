I developed a database using Django and XAMPP in Windows Server 2012 R2 to store sensitive information. 
Technically it works the same as file comparison project, everyone can tap in to the server through web browser in the network. 
But, they need to have the correct credentials (password protected). Download README and Screenshot.png for more information
